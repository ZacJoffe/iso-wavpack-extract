# iso-wavpack-extract
A small script I wrote to extract files from `.iso.wv` files.

## Usage
You must have the [`p7zip`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/P7zip) package. Move `extract.sh` to the directory with the `.iso.wv` files, and simply run:
```
./extract.sh
```
The script will create a subdirectory for each `.iso.wv` file.
